  <h3>A Brief History</h3>
       <img alt="placeholder image" src="http://typographyforlawyers.com/images/tally-of-types.jpg">

   <p class="lh1">
    Times New Roman is named after the Times of London,
    British Newspaper. The font is drawn by Victor Lardent,
    an artist in the Times, with Stanley Morison from Monotype
    leading the project. The font is completed in 1931 after
    some issue between Monotype and Linotype and then commonly
    be used in newspaper. Being used as the font for a daily
    medium, the font slowly is familiarlized by millions of
    people. More and more documents is printed after the font.
    it even be liscensed by Apple for Macintosh in 1984 and by Microsoft for Windoms in 1992, which
    make the number of documents set in Times New Roman
     exploded. <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/times-new-roman.html">See the article</a></p>

  <h3>Origin</h3>


  <p class="lh1">The origin of the font is abit of a mystery.
    The 16th-centyry French typographer Robert Granjon
    has been said to be a starting point of Times New Roman.
    While some other Monotype font could be the direct ancestor
    of it. For example, Plantin, side by side with Time New Roman,
    has some unmistakable similarity. <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/times-new-roman.html">See the article</a></p>

     <h3 >Criticism</h3>
      <p class="lh1">Despite its success, Times New Roman recieved many
      criticisms. There's not much to complain about Times
      New Roman, as it is a general font that is created
      for newspaper. But when Times New Roman is used as
      decoratives on a book, advertisement, etc, it says,
      "I submitted to the font of least resistance." As Matthew
      Butterick criticize the font: "Times New Roman is not a
      font choice so much as the absence of a font choice, like
      the blackness of deep space is not a color. To look at
      Times New Roman is to gaze into the void." <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/times-new-roman.html">See the article</a></p>
