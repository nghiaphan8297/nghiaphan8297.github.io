<h3>Has design become too hard?</h3>
<p>
	Digital design has changed because of the <del >advanced</del><ins>change of</ins> technology that make designers have to master more and more tools. <del hidden>Some designers may say that the “fun” has gone out of it.</del> An example of this is the obstacles of web design. In the early, pixels were not standardized between PC and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized. And when we got a standardized layout language for the web, browser supported it <strong>differently</strong> <i>for years</i>. Then, preference settings, outdated browser, wonky operating system,… </p>

<p><del hidden>Design was never easy, and it’s getting harder.</del> Designers say that today’s code is too hard. But was it ever easy? Today, we’re using many forms of device so, instead of pretending or wishing that everyone used the same platform with the same setting, designers have to design <i>accordingly</i>. Then browsers support web standard well enough for us to use them. And thank to that, once we had mastered our <abbr tilte="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr tilte="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML<abbr> and JavaScript, we wouldn’t need to learn much anything new. Surely, there are other frameworks that could be better but you don’t need to learn much more than that. You dont have to know <strong>every framework</strong>.</p>

<mark>In the early days of web design, beginning in 1995, pixels were not standardized between PC and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized, period; and when we got a standardized layout language for the web, every browser supported it differently for years.</mark>

<p>In the early days of web design, beginning in 1995, pixels were not standardized between <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized, period; and when we got a <strong>standardized layout language</strong> for the web, every browser supported it differently <i>for years</i>.</p>

<p>Later, when standards were better supported in browsers, some of us pretended that “everybody” had a <code>600 x 400</code> monitor (and then an 800 x 600, and then 1024 x 768), but these too were consensual hallucinations. And even in those rose-colored fixed-width days, there was always a client or a QA tester whose user preference settings, outdated browser, or wonky operating system blew our carefully constructed fixed-width layouts to hell.</p>
